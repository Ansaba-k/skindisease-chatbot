#  DermAI ðŸ¤–ðŸ©º â€“ AI-Powered Skin Disease Chatbot

---

##  Project Overview

DermAI is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide both instant analysis and progress tracking for skin conditions. Users can upload images of affected areas and receive preliminary insights powered by computer vision and language models. A key innovation is the ability to track skin condition progression over time by uploading images at regular intervals (daily/weekly). DermAI compares these images side-by-side or via slideshow to identify visible changes, detect improvements or worsening, and suggest further actionsâ€”like continuing home remedies or seeking medical attention. It also retains a chat and image history to give users a complete timeline of their skin health journey.

##  Problem Statement

Millions lack access to regular dermatological consultations, often relying on guesswork or static online results. Most AI tools provide only single-instance diagnosis with no follow-up tracking. This leads to missed signs of deterioration or unnecessary worry. DermAI addresses this by offering ongoing monitoring, enabling users to visualize changes in their skin conditions, understand the effectiveness of treatments, and get AI-guided suggestions based on historical data. It bridges the gap between one-time detection and continuous care in an affordable and accessible way.
