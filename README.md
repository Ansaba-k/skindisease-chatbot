#  DermAI ðŸ¤–ðŸ©º â€“ AI-Powered Skin Disease Chatbot

---

##  Project Overview

DermAI is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide both instant analysis and progress tracking for skin conditions. Users can upload images of affected areas and receive preliminary insights powered by computer vision and language models. A key innovation is the ability to track skin condition progression over time by uploading images at regular intervals (daily/weekly). DermAI compares these images side-by-side or via slideshow to identify visible changes, detect improvements or worsening, and suggest further actionsâ€”like continuing home remedies or seeking medical attention. It also retains a chat and image history to give users a complete timeline of their skin health journey.

##  Problem Statement

People often rely on memory to track skin issues, missing subtle changes or delaying care. Most AI tools offer only one-time diagnosis without follow-up. DermAI fills this gap by enabling ongoing image-based tracking, offering AI-driven analysis, and guiding users with timely, visual, and personalized skin health support.
