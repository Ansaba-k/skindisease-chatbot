Project Description

DermAI is an AI-powered chatbot that allows users to upload skin images and receive preliminary insights about possible skin conditions. In addition, users can chat with the bot to learn more about symptoms, causes, treatments, and whether to seek medical help. Itâ€™s an innovative blend of computer vision and natural language understanding to improve skin health awareness and accessibility.

The Problem Statement

Millions struggle to access dermatologists and reliable skin health information. People often rely on random internet searches or ignore symptoms altogether, leading to delayed or incorrect treatment.


---

The Solution

Our chatbot helps users:

Upload an image of the affected skin area.

Get AI-driven analysis to predict potential conditions.

Ask follow-up questions about symptoms, care, and next steps.

Understand whether they should consult a dermatologist.


This provides a cost-effective, instant, and accessible first-level screening and support system for skin diseases.
